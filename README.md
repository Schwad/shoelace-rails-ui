# In active development 👷‍♂️ 🏗️ 🚧

At time of writing this gem gives you working Shoelace with the sl-light theme (tested against a new Rails 7 app). It also allows you to author components with the `<%= sl_drawer %>` ERB-flavored format. There's active work (see below) to get this gem to a stable and reliable stage, so feel free to contribute!
