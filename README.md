# In active development 👷‍♂️ 🏗️ 🚧

At time of writing this gem gives you working Shoelace with the sl-light theme (tested against a new Rails 7 app). It also allows you to author components with the `<%= sl_drawer %>` ERB-flavored format. There's active work (see below) to get this gem to a stable and reliable stage, so feel free to contribute!

# Shoelace::Rails::Ui
Get started with [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) today, the Rails way!

## Quickstart

1. `bundle add shoelace-rails-ui`
1. `rails g shoelace:install`
1. presto!

```erb
# ERB-flavored shoelace.
<%= sl_alert variant:"warning", open: true, closable: true do %>
  Hello from shoelace!!!
<% end %>

# Is the equivalent of
  <sl-alert variant="warning" open closable>
    Hello from shoelace!!!
  </sl-alert>

<%= sl_divider %>

# Nested blocks
<%= sl_details summary:"Togglable" do %>
  <%= sl_alert variant:"primary", open: true do %>
    This is doubly-nested shoelace
  <% end %>
<% end %>

#=>
#  <sl-details summary="Togglable">
#    <sl-alert variant="primary" open>
#      This is doubly-nested shoelace
#    </sl-alert>
#  </sl-details>

<%= sl_divider %>

# You can throw in raw shoelace as well to gradually migrate existing apps.
 <sl-dropdown>
  <sl-button slot="trigger" caret>But you aren't forced</sl-button>
  <sl-menu>
    <sl-menu-item>To use</sl-menu-item>
    <sl-menu-item>ERB</sl-menu-item>
    <sl-divider></sl-divider>
    <sl-menu-item checked>It's totally</sl-menu-item>
    <sl-menu-item disabled>optional :)</sl-menu-item>
  </sl-menu>
</sl-dropdown>

<%= sl_divider %>

# Works like a dream with Hotwire 🚀
<%= turbo_frame_tag :slow, src: static_pages_lazy_path, loading: :lazy do %>
  <%= sl_tag variant:"warning" do %>
    Loading lazily with hotwire!
  <% end %>
  <%= sl_progress_bar indeterminate: true %>
<% end %>

<%= sl_divider %>
```
