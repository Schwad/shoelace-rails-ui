# TODO

- [ ] Automate pulling down and version sync from shoelace-style/shoelace
- [ ] Bundle required assets directly into gem
- [ ] just shove and require the files maybe
- [ ] Create codegen script
- [ ] Adopt shoelace-rails style functionality natively into:
  * - [ ] form_with
  * - [ ] form_for
  * - [ ] form_tag
  * - [ ] image_tag
  * - [ ] link_to
- [ ] Generate and publish an ERB-style shoelace docs page
  * e.g. `<%= sl_drawer %>` and optional args
  * possibly do vanilla Markdown to start. This is my library it doesn't need to look identical.
